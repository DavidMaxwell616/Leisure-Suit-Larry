   <U>Beginning Notes</U>
   <P>
   If you ever have too many inventory objects, you can always drop an object,
   and pick it up later. No one will steal it, and it'll stay there
   for ya forever.
   <P>
      Whenever you die, you have to choose a door. It's randomly selected
   whether it quits LSL, transports you back to where you were, unharmed,
   or allows you another chance. Pure guesswork.
   <P>
   You can save and load your game using the "save" and "load" commands.
   You name your games with a one word description, and in case you forget
   any of the names, they're kept in the LSL directory as gamename.dat
   <P>
   <U>Fun Things to Try in the Game</U>
   <P>
   Even though you die, just for fun, try "eat"ing any of the girls
   in the game. (waitress in disco, blonde in casino, etc.)
   <P>
