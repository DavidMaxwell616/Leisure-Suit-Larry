   <h1>Leisure Suit Larry</h1> is a text-based adventure game released by Sierra many moons ago. It&#8217;s the only text adventure that Sierra released and is the precursor to the Leisure Suit Larry series.</p>
   <p>The basic controls are E, N, S, W, U and D. Type INVENTORY to see what you&#8217;re carrying. At the top of the screen you can see where you can go and what you can interact with at the given location. You begin the game with $2,500 and can always go to the casino to try and win more money. Exact commands you need to type are in capitals.</p>
